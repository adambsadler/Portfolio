                    <h1>About Adam</h1>
                    <p>Hello! For those of you who may not know, my name is Adam Sadler. With over 10 years of
                        experience working in the tabletop games industry, I have made a name for myself as both an
                        accomplished game designer as well as a diligent project manager responsible for all aspects of
                        the game development process. Before all of that, I spent several years playing bass in various
                        bands after high school. Eventually, my twin brother Brady and I started a fantasy themed heavy
                        metal band called Lorenguard. If you are interested in listening to some of the music, feel free
                        to click on the album cover on the right.</p>
                    <p>After a few years of playing music and working random jobs, I decided that I wanted to go back to
                        school. I started at Purdue University at the age of 24, and I began with a major in Computer
                        Science. However, after only one semester, I changed my major to Fine Arts and I'll
                        never really understand why. That decision has always been one of my only big regrets in my life. I did
                        stick with it though and graduated from Purdue in 2010 with a Bachelor's Degree in Fine Arts.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>Shortly after graduating from Purdue, I accepted a job as an Associate Game Producer at my
                        favorite board game publisher, Fantasy Flight Games. At FFG, I worked on several popular game
                        lines, such as <b><i>Twilight Imperium</b></i>, but my biggest accomplishment at the company was
                        working as lead designer on <b><i>Descent: Journeys in the Dark Second Edition</b></i>. It was
                        my work on this flagship title that led to my new role as Managing Game Designer, where I
                        managed a team of designers and producers working on several big titles, such as <b><i>Star
                                Wars: X-Wing</b></i>. After almost 3 years at the company, I decided it was time to move
                        back to Indiana and pursue game design on a freelance basis while exploring other professional
                        opportunites. I was fortunate to meet several very passionate professionals at the company who I
                        stayed in contact with after I left and some of those contacts were instrumental in the next
                        stage of my professional game design career.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>After leaving FFG, I designed board games with my brother Brady as freelancers while we worked as
                    Proposal Writers. Our first published design as freelance Game Designers was the popular
                    <b><i>Warhammer Quest: The Adventure Card Game</b></i> published by Fantasy Flight Games. We
                    designed several other games together over the years, including popular licenses like <b>The
                        Walking Dead</b>. After we designed <b><i>Street Masters</i></b> for a new publisher named
                    Blacklist Games, we began a working relationship with Blacklist that would eventually lead to
                    us both working as full-time employees for the company.

                    <p>While I have very much enjoyed my time as a professional in the tabletop games industry, I have
                        always found it difficult to ingore my
                        growing desire to learn coding and pursue my interest in computers and technology. Now that I'm in a place in my life where I can finally do something about that regret I've always had about changing my major in college, I made the decision to go for it. In late 2021, I enrolled in a
                        Software
                        Development coding bootcamp at <a href="https://elevenfifty.org/" target="_blank">Eleven Fifty
                            Academy</a> and I graduated in February of 2022. I look forward to taking
                        everything I
                        have learned so far and applying it to new and exciting opportunities in the tech industry.</p>
